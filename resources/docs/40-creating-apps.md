# Apps Tutorial

There are several ways in which applications can be created with Clojang:

* A stand-alone Clojure application that needs to communicate with Erlang/OTP
  applications.
* A Clojure application that is managed by an Erlang/OTP application, with the
  Clojure application being a JVM process child in the Erlang/OTP application's
  supervision tree.
* A Clojure application that manages child processes in its own supervision
  tree.

This document covers examples of all three.
